### Unknown Chinese Manufacturer Sixbuilder

-   The components of Sixbuilder are arguably just too large to be classed as in scale.
-   The vehicle that should fit on the back is instead replaced with a similar version which is completely out of scale.
-   The package refers to the name of this figure as Slusher Car.
