Unreleased and miscellaneous
----------------------------

-   Hot Rodimus was later re-released as a Toys'R'Us exclusive with purchases of THS-02 Convoy.
-   Trade show images originally suggested a third wave of *Smallest Transforming Transformers*, which would have added the then-unreleased [Hot Rodimus](Hot_Rod_(G1)/toys "wikilink"), as well as still-unreleased versions of [Skids](Skids_(G1) "wikilink"), [Tracks](Tracks_(G1) "wikilink"), and Megatron's stock and silencer accessories. Skids and Tracks were reportedly unproduced for cost reasons.[1]
