Notes
-----

-   The Heero version comes complete with handgun and shoulder blaster, the shoulder blaster is compatible with [Red Alert](Red_Alert "wikilink"), [Tigertrack](Tigertrack "wikilink") and [Sideswipe](Sideswipe "wikilink"). The handgun is not due to the Takara figures not having peg holes in their hands.
-   There is technically also another version of Breakdown included with the [Menasor](Menasor "wikilink") Gestalt.

Breakdown
---------

### Heero Breakdown

-   This is a G1 recolour of the G2 Breakdown.

### Heero G2 Breakdown

-   Uses the same mold as [Tigertrack](Tigertrack "wikilink"). This mold is inspired by the Takara [Sideswipe](Sideswipe "wikilink") mold but has subtle differences mainly around the hands. Also this can come with an alternative roof without the lights on
